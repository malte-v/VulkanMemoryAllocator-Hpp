# VulkanMemoryAllocator-Hpp
These bindings use all the handy stuff from `Vulkan-Hpp`: wrapper classes, type safe enums, `std::vector`s, `Optional` etc. They are generated by the generator used by `Vulkan-Hpp`, that's why they look so similar.

Current VMA version: 2.3.0

Warning: The bindings are not thoroughly tested yet. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue: https://github.com/malte-v/VulkanMemoryAllocator-Hpp/issues/new

## Setup
Just copy vk_mem_alloc.h and vk_mem_alloc.hpp to your project.

## Usage
```c++
// In *one* source file:
#define VMA_IMPLEMENTATION

#include "vk_mem_alloc.hpp"
```

## Configuration
### `namespace`
If you don't like the `vma::` prefix:
```c++
#define VMA_HPP_NAMESPACE <prefix>
```
### Designated Initializers
If you have access to c++20 compiler and want to take advantage of designated initializers:
```c++
#define VMA_HPP_NO_STRUCT_CONSTRUCTORS
```
See [Vulkan-HPP readme](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp#designated-initializers).
